--Description--

As it is, the OS has a main terminal and a simple memory manager as well as
drivers for keyboard, vga, filesystem, and disk. the linux commands "ls",
"cd", "clear", and "reboot" are simulated through the vga driver (the typed 
words  are parsed when enter is pressed) since there is no concept of 
processes. The boot loader and the filesystem understand only the ext2 format,
and so the image is formatted and always mounted as ext2 when adding files to
it.

--Running--

-To emulate running the operating system on a linux machine, make sure you 
have bochs installed and a properly configured ext2 image under the image dir.
While inside the main directory, type "bochs" and at the prompt type 
"continue" or "c". Inside the emulator, the kernel file name must be 
provided during the booting phase, the image that comes with the project 
has the name of the kernel as "kernel.bin".

--Directory Structure--

-Files pertaining to the boot sector are located under the boot dir.

-Files pertaining to the 32-bit kernel code are located under kernel dir.

-The image directory contains the disk-image created with bximage and 
formatted using mkfs.ext2.

--Compiling and setting up img file--

-Boot Sector code is assembled using nasm and then copied using 'dd' command
to block 0 of the disk-image.

-The kernel code is compiled only to objet code, and it is linked 
with a starting kernel-entry procedure (order of linkage matters here, kernel
entry procedure must be first object file and since there is no main method 
to jump to, the address to which the boot loader jumps to is chosen 
arbitrarily).

-The disk image is then mounted and the kernel.bin file generated from the 
linking phase is added to the folder as a regular file. The image now contains 
the kernel as a linux file and the boot sector code will then find it.
