--Directory Structure--

-Files pertaining to the boot sector are located under the boot dir.

-Files pertaining to the 32-bit kernel code are located under kernel dir.

-The image directory would normally contain the disk-image created with
bximage and formatted using mkfs.ext2.

--To Run--

-Boot Sector code is assembled using nasm and then copied using 'dd' command
to block 0 of the disk-image.

-The kernel code is compiled only to objet code, and it is linked 
with a starting kernel-entry procedure (order of linkage matters here, kernel
entry procedure must be first object file and since there is no main method 
to jump to, the address to which the boot loader jumps to is chosen 
arbitrarily).

-The disk image is then mounted and the kernel.bin file generated from the 
linkage is added to the folder as a regular file. The image now contains 
the kernel as a linux file and the boot sector will then find it.

-Finally the image is ran using bochs, the setup of bochs is located at the top
of the directory tree (bochsrc).
